    </div>
    <div clas="content">
    <p>Hello! My name is Esam Mahmud.
    I am a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong interest in web development. With several years of experience in front-end and back-end development, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, java and various frameworks and libraries.
    Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, including e-commerce websites, content management systems, and web applications. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver elegant and user-friendly solutions.
    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest trends and advancements in web development, attending tech conferences, and continuously learning new technologies. I am always excited to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving web landscape.
    Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any inquiries or would like to discuss potential collaboration opportunities, please feel free to get in touch with me.</p>
